## Homework ¹ 10 inspired by Flask

This is my first Flask work. I've decided to create my simple Flask 
app by using class CandidateFinder. This approach provides simple and
comfortable way to start app.

__The composition of project:__

1) candidates.json
2) classes.py
3) main.py
4) requirements.txt

_candidates.json_ - the source of candidates' data
_classes.py_ - a unit containing class CandidateFinder to prepare and start Flask app
_main.py_ - a main app file to start app
_requirements.txt_ - list of units demanded to start the app
